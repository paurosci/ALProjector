# ALProjector

This repo contains the implemented code and resources for building a DIY low cost Alphanumeric Laser Projector.

* The Arduino project files to control the stepper motor using the IR sensor feedback and the interrupts of the laser beam to form the desired characters.
* The Sketchup 3D source files in order to print the stepper motor drum and mirrors holder.
* The Java-based interface that opens the COM port communication with the Arduino board and sends the customised alphanumeric messages. Please note that this package is up to date but I have included the source files for legacy purposes.
